The calculator must have the four standard arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide)
It must have a display register for the values entered and the results.
It must have a 'clear' function to remove all memory content and initialise it.
It must have an 'entry' function (method) to enter a value into the display register.
It must have an 'equals' function to evaluate the arithmetic operation i.e. new_display_value = display_value OP memory value
